# Note Taker Application

As a small business owner I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete. To do this I have created a nore-taking application.

# How it works

When the Note Taker app is opened, it presents a landing page with a link to a notes page. When the link is clicked on, it presents a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

Enter a new note title and the note’s text "Save Note" button and "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page.

Click on the Save button and the new note entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear.

Click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation. Click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page to be presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears.
When clicking the trash Icon it will delete any completed or unnecessary tasks
